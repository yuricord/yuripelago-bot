Discord bridge for Archipelago in python

[Discord Link](https://discord.gg/5v9P3qNPXp)

## Setup:
See the [SETUP GUIDE](docs/setup.md)

## Funtionality:

### Core
This bot will monitor and track progress as you play through your Archipelago run.  
This allows for some fun stats to be collected, logging from the bot on item checks that are found, and death notices from DeathLink players.

When a check is found or a deathlink is received, it'll output the check in a discord channel.

```
Examples:
An item for yourself: 
> Quasky_SM64 found their Power Star
> Check: LLL: Boil the Big Bully

An item for someone else:
> Quasky_SM64 sent Lens of Truth to Quasky_OOT
> Check: LLL: Bully the Bullies

When someone with deathlink dies, it'll shame them in this channel.
> Deathlink received from: Quasky_OOT
```

What this bot will NOT do:
 - DM / ping you without consent
 - Find items for you
 - Give hints
 - Find the reason the children of this world have forgotten the meaning of Christmas

---
### Ketchmeup
You can also ask the bot to DM you all the items you've gained since last asking him.
(See the registration below)

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**
- This will send you EVERYTHING you've registered for since last asking. So even as you're playing and someone sends you an item, it'll still appear in the queue to be sent to you. (as the bot has no idea if you're playing or not)
- The bot will NOT log items you give to your own game. You're expected to remember what you find for yourself
- However the bot only understands slots. So if you're playing two games, the bot just assumes the other game is someone else and logs it. While ignoring the checks from your own game.

```
Example:
You         || Item                         || Sender      || Location
Quasky_OOT2 || Piece of Heart               || Quasky_OOT4 || Gerudo Training Ground Near Scarecrow Chest
Quasky_OOT2 || Rupees (20)                  || Quasky_OOT4 || Ganons Castle Shadow Trial Front Chest
Quasky_OOT2 || Bow                          || Quasky_OOT4 || Ganons Tower Boss Key Chest
Quasky_OOT2 || Gold Skulltula Token         || Quasky_OOT4 || Sheik at Colossus
Quasky_OOT2 || Rupees (200)                 || Quasky_OOT4 || KF Midos Bottom Left Chest
Quasky_OOT2 || Gold Skulltula Token         || Quasky_OOT4 || KF Shop Item 6
```
Hopefully that makes sense.
